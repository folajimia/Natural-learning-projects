I hope you would feel prepared and that you have an understanding of this system and how it works. If you want to start tinkering with code, feel free to pick up from the intro tutorial and teach a neural network how to detect handwritten digits.

You should also continue your education by learning the theoretical and mathematical underpinnings of the concepts we discussed here. Good questions to ask now include:

What other kinds of cost functions exist? Which are better for which applications?
What’s the algorithm to actually calculate new weights using gradient descent?
What are the applications for machine learning in the fields you’re already knowledgeable about? What new magic can you wield by mixing this spell with others in your spell book?
Great learning resources include:

Coursera’s Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng. This is the one I started with. Starts with regression then moves to classification and neural networks.
Coursera’s Neural Networks for Machine Learning by Geoffrey Hinton. More focused on neural networks and its visual applications.
Stanford’s CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition by Andrej Karpathy. It’s interesting to see some advanced concepts and the state of the art in visual recognition using deep neural networks.
The Neural Network Zoo is a great resource to learn more about the different types of neural networks.
